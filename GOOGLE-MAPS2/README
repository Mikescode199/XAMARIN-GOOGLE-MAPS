In this porject you have to use 'GOOGLE MAPS' ON Xamarin

You've got to add it in the main page. In this project you can look for a place, then it shows it!

If you want, you can desing a Register to user then a button that goes to the Google maps on your app 

If you have questions, send us a message or go to the group 'Mike's code'in the page
